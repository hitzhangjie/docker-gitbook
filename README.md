# gitbook-cli

Though [gitbook-cli](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-cli) have benn deprecated officially, it is still a very popular EBook generator.

If we try to install gitbook-cli by npm or homebrew package manager, it may not work as expected for some compatibility reasons of nodejs and graceful-fs dependencies. If you don't spend more time on solving this problem, you could just pull and use the docker image [hitzhangjie/gitbook-cli:latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hitzhangjie/gitbook-cli) instead.
